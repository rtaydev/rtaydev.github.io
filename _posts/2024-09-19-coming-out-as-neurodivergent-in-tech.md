I’ll admit it—I spent a lot of time wrestling with whether or not to “come out” as neurodivergent in professional settings. It’s hard enough to confront this part of your identity personally, let alone share it with family, friends, recruiters, or potential employers.

If you're reading this and nodding your head, you're probably navigating a similar journey. Maybe you're worried that revealing you have ADHD, autism, or another form of neurodivergence will change how people see you. That the "genius coder" label might shift to "problematic" or "unreliable."

Guess what? You're not alone, and the conversation around neurodivergence in the workplace is one we *need* to have.

#### The Double Life of a Neurodivergent Developer

As a software engineer, I often found myself balancing two lives: the one where I crushed deadlines, debugged complex issues, and contributed to groundbreaking projects—and the one where I quietly struggled with sensory overload, anxiety, or just plain burnout from masking (pretending to be “neurotypical”).

Coming to terms with my diagnosis of autistic ADHD was both a revelation and a struggle. On one hand, everything made *sense* now: why I’d get hyper-focused on certain coding problems while completely forgetting basic self-care, or why team meetings would leave me drained for hours afterward. On the other hand, the fear of being misunderstood—or worse, labeled as "broken"—was real.

That fear is reinforced by the subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) stigmas society still attaches to neurodivergence. For instance, a [2020 study by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/about-deloitte-uk/articles/neurodiversity-at-work.html) found that many neurodivergent individuals hide their diagnosis at work because they’re worried about being unfairly judged or overlooked for promotions. It’s not just me.

#### Neurodivergence in Tech: The Unseen Advantages

Before diving into the struggles, let’s address something many people miss: neurodivergent individuals often bring extraordinary talents to the table. Hyper-focus, creative problem-solving, and pattern recognition are strengths many people with ADHD and autism possess in abundance. [Dr. Nancy Doyle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drnancydoyle/2021/08/18/neurodiversity-at-work-is-evolving-fast-what-does-this-mean-for-inclusion/?sh=42b847e62957), a neurodiversity expert, talks about how these attributes can make us particularly well-suited to tech roles where critical thinking and deep dives into complex problems are required.

Yet, many companies aren't ready to tap into this talent. The tech industry prides itself on being progressive, but it can lag when it comes to truly embracing neurodiversity. Recruiters often lean on traditional hiring practices that unintentionally weed out neurodivergent candidates. Questions like, "Tell me about a time you handled a fast-paced, multitasking environment" may be meant to assess agility but can feel like a nightmare to someone with ADHD who thrives in focused, structured settings.

#### Tips for Navigating Disclosure

1. **Know Your Value First**: Before sharing your diagnosis, remind yourself of your skills, contributions, and value. Be confident in what you bring to the table.

2. **Choose Your Timing**: You don’t have to disclose in an interview. Many neurodivergent individuals find it helpful to bring it up later—during negotiations, after securing the job, or after building rapport with their team.

3. **Be Clear About Your Needs**: If you’re going to disclose, frame it around how your employer can help you thrive. For example, you might ask for noise-cancelling headphones in an open-plan office or flexible deadlines to accommodate hyper-focus periods.

4. **Find a Supportive Employer**: Look for companies with public statements about inclusivity and neurodiversity. Places like SAP and Microsoft have been leading the charge with neurodiversity hiring programs, ensuring their work environments are supportive.

#### To Employers: Why It’s Time to Rethink Neurodiversity

This part’s for the recruiters and hiring managers who might read this. It’s crucial to understand that neurodivergence isn’t something to be "fixed"—it’s something to be *accommodated* and even celebrated. Neurodivergent individuals often approach problems from unique angles, see details others miss, and excel in specialized tasks.

Stigma often comes from misunderstanding. Research from the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2022/04/how-companies-can-support-neurodiverse-employees) suggests that simple accommodations like flexible hours, sensory-friendly workspaces, and clear, structured communication can be game-changers. Even more important? Foster an environment of trust where employees feel safe to disclose without fear of being judged.

#### Debunking the Myths

1. **“Neurodivergent people aren’t reliable.”**  
   This is false. Many of us excel in areas of focus, commitment, and innovation—once the right environment is provided.

2. **“They need too many accommodations.”**  
   Accommodations are often simple and inexpensive. Things like flexible deadlines or the ability to work remotely can make a huge difference.

3. **“Neurodivergent employees aren’t team players.”**  
   We may communicate differently, but we’re just as capable of collaboration. In fact, our different perspectives can often help teams succeed by adding diverse thinking.

#### Let’s Change the Narrative

It’s time we flipped the script. Neurodivergence doesn’t have to be a barrier to success—it’s often an advantage. By embracing diversity, tech companies stand to benefit from an untapped pool of incredible talent. For neurodivergent individuals like me, it’s empowering to know that we’re not broken or inadequate; we simply think, work, and thrive differently.

At the end of the day, it’s all about creating spaces where people feel comfortable being themselves. As someone who’s walked this path, I can say this with confidence: the more we talk openly about neurodivergence, the easier it becomes for others to join the conversation.

For the employers out there: By being more inclusive, you're not just doing the “right thing”—you’re creating a richer, more innovative workspace. The future of tech is diverse, and neurodiversity is a big part of that.

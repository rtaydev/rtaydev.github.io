<h3>About</h3>
<p class="about-text">The mission is to raise awareness, provide resources, and offer support for neurodivergent individuals, especially developers, to help them access assessments, find a community, and to offer advice on professional support. In the future, I hope to be able to offer financial support to those who need it, through a network of sponsors. However, this lofty dream is still in the planning stages.</p>
<p class="about-text">As a neurodivergent developer myself, I have faced many challenges in my career, and I want to help others avoid the same pitfalls. I have been fortunate to have a supportive family and a great therapist, but I know that not everyone has access to the same resources. I want to be able to provide that support to others, so that they can succeed in their careers and live fulfilling lives.</p>

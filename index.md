The mission is to raise awareness, provide resources, and offer support for neurodivergent individuals, especially developers, to help them access assessments, find a community, and to offer advice on professional support. In the future, I hope to be able to offer financial support to those who need it, through a network of sponsors. However, this lofty dream is still in the planning stages.
